            Always had a passion for technology, cemented after receiving my first laptop and iPod after a serious accident aged 11. At University studying Economics and Social Studies, I confirmed the idea that I enjoyed problem solving challenges, with an ideal solution of helping people out. During this time, I received a compensation for the accident that I used to start a property company with my parents.

            Having found, purchased, renovated and now continuing to manage the properties, I am in a position where I can afford to take up a new challenge and career. I love being kept on my toes and solving problems, so after seeing a friend start his journey in the web development industry a couple of years ago, I enquired further and found that it was right for me.

            sorting the properties, I enrolled in numerous online web development courses, which included freeCodeCamp, Codeacademy and unity. I then enrolled at General Assembly as it seemed the perfect course and environment to start my journey as a Web Developer. I would love to continue my learning development in my next role.
