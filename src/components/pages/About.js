Always had a passion for technology, cemented after receiving my first laptop and iPod
after a serious accident aged 11. At University studying Economics and Social Studies, I
confirmed the idea that I enjoyed problem solving challenges, with an ideal solution of
helping people out. During this time, I received compensation for the accident that I
used to start a property company with my parents.

Having found, purchased, renovated and now continuing to manage the properties, I am in a
position where I can afford to take up a new challenge and career. I love being kept on my
toes and solving problems, so after seeing a friend start his journey in the web
development industry a couple of years ago, I enquired further and found that it
was right for me.

          <h2 className="subtitle">
Whilst sorting the properties, I enrolled in numerous online web development courses,
which included freeCodeCamp, Codeacademy and unity. I then enrolled at General
Assembly as it seemed the perfect course and environment to start my journey
as a Web Developer. I would love to continue my learning development in my next role.
